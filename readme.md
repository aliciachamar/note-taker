  ## Installation

  No installation is necessary; the app is deployed on [Heroku](https://note-taker-nash.herokuapp.com/notes).


  ## Usage

  When the application is loaded, the user is shown a screen where they can enter a new note with a title and text. Once the title and text fields have both received input, a save button will appear to add the note to the database. Once the save button is clicked, the note will appear in the left-hand column for future reference. It will also have a trash can icon to delete the note from the database.
